# Datastrutures and Algorithms code implementation for C/CPP,C#,Java, Python

* Each alogrithm or Datastrutures implementation code is in C++/C , C#, Java, python. 
* This project includes most of the important seacrhing and sorting techinques. 
* Data structures like linked listed, double linked list, round linked list, stack , queue and many variations of these data stuctures are included in this project.
* Tress, DFS,BFS also included.
* Towers of hanoi.

## Code information
* For CPP/C implementation please visit Datastrutures-Algorithms-CPP
* For CPP/C implementation please visit Datastrutures-Algorithms-CSharp
* For CPP/C implementation please visit Datastrutures-Algorithms-Java
* For CPP/C implementation please visit Datastrutures-Algorithms-Python

## NOTE
* All the code is written on Windows platform using Visual Stuido for CPP/C,C#,Python and Netbeans for Java.
* Code implementation is for learning and practicing the algorithms and data structures in most commonly used languages. 
* Code is not tested.
* Project is still under development.
* Feel free to contribute and reuse.
